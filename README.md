# Real-time-Grass-Simulation


Key features :

1. Natural randomized grass randomly distributed over an area with bends,color and height computed per segment per blade .
2. Segmented blades (3) for higher level of detail.
3. Customizable grass height .
4. Walking/Hovering/crawling animation.(Automatic and manual movements)
5. Darker shader in bottom segments to fake shadows.
6. Natural wind waves.
7. Movements,Wind weight calculated per segment.
8. Prints Blade count and FPS counter to demonstrate GPU efficiency.
9. Add/increase or remove/decrease blade counts.
10.Uses texture mapping to generate natural looking bends,color and height.
11.Mouse controlled wind direction.


+/- increase/decrease grass field area/subtract blades

L -> increase grass height

l -> decrease grass height

LEFT -> Rotate camera right

RIGHT-> Rotate camera left

UP -> Rotate camera up

DOWN-> Rotate camera down

m/M -> Switch on : "a rat in the field" effect.

w/W ->  move front on grass 

s/S -> move back on grass 

d/D -> move right on grass 

a/A -> move left on grass
