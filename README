Grass Simulation

Tushar Singh
CSCI4229/5229 Fall 2014

Objective : Demonstrate Multi-instancing through GLSL.



Makefile to compile. The program uses GLTools library.

Key bindings


+ -> decrease grass field area/subtract blades
- -> increase grass field area/add blades
L -> increase grass height
l -> decrease grass height
LEFT -> Rotate camera right
RIGHT-> Rotate camera left
UP -> Rotate camera up
DOWN-> Rotate camera down
m/M -> Switch on : "a rat in the field" effect.
w/W ->  move front on grass 
s/S -> move back on grass 
d/D -> move right on grass 
a/A -> move left on grass 
click left/right on the screen to input wind directions.
ESC -> escape program.


Key features :

1. Natural randomized grass randomly distributed over an area with bends,color and height computed per segment per blade .
2. Segmented blades (3) for higher level of detail.
3. Customizable grass height .
4. Walking/Hovering/crawling animation.(Automatic and manual movements)
5. Darker shader in bottom segments to fake shadows.
6. Natural wind waves.
7. Movements,Wind weight calculated per segment.
8. Prints Blade count and FPS counter to demonstrate GPU efficiency.
9. Add/increase or remove/decrease blade counts.
10.Uses texture mapping to generate natural looking bends,color and height.
11.Mouse controlled wind direction.

Project work distribution :

20% - Research and Study.
20% - Shader setup &  Modeling.
20% - computing weights for bends, mouse bindings ,natural shading.
30% - Adding animation (wind,grass movements)
10% - keyboard,camera controls,antialiasing,FPS etc .
